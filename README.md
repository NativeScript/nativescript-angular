# NativeScript Angular
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NativeScript/nativescript-angular.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NativeScript/nativescript-angular)

This repository contains the code for integration of NativeScript with Angular. 

[NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) is a framework which enables developers to write truly native mobile applications for Android and iOS using JavaScript and CSS. [Angular](https://angular.io/) is one of the most popular open source JavaScript frameworks for application development. We [worked closely with developers at Google](http://angularjs.blogspot.bg/2015/12/building-mobile-apps-with-angular-2-and.html) to make Angular in NativeScript a reality. The result is a software architecture that allows you to build mobile apps using the same framework—and in some cases the same code—that you use to build Angular web apps, with the performance you’d expect from native code. [Read more about building truly native mobile apps with NativeScript and Angular](https://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/ng-chapter-0).

## Explore the examples

The `ng-sample` app is meant for testing stuff while developing the renderer code, and isn't the best example out there. You can take a look at these sample apps that use the published builds from npm:

* [Hello world starter](https://github.com/NativeScript/template-hello-world-ng)
* [Master-detail template](https://github.com/NativeScript/template-master-detail-ng)
* [Drawer navigation template](https://github.com/NativeScript/template-drawer-navigation-ng)
* [TabView navigation template](https://github.com/NativeScript/template-tab-navigation-ng)
* [NativeScript Angular SDK examples](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-sdk-examples-ng)
* [TodoMVC sample implementation](https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-ng-todomvc)

## Contribute
We love PRs! Check out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [development workflow for local setup](DevelopmentWorkflow.md).

## Known issues

1. There are certain issues with the Parse5DomAdapter and we'll likely need to provide our own later on:
  * Self-closing elements (`<Label text="Name" /><Button text="Save" />`) get parsed wrong (in this case Button gets parsed as a Label child.
